# 100 Days of Code Log

### Day 1: May 1st, 2019
#### Today's Progress ####
Finished the [Pokemon Scaper Lab Bonus tests](https://github.com/big32mike/pokemon-scraper-online-web-pt-021119)
- Named and optional arguments and metaprogramming
- SQLite gem DB queries return an array of rows, of which the rows are arrays of values

Completed the 2 ORM mapping labs.
- setup DB[:conn] hash in environment.rb and use it to talk to the database.
- we leave id (or any autoincremented field) nil during object initialization so we can set it later
- we turn db rows into Ruby objects
