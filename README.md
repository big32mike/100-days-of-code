# 100 Days of Code Log

### Day 1: May 1st, 2019
#### Today's Progress
Finished the [Pokemon Scaper Lab Bonus tests](https://github.com/big32mike/pokemon-scraper-online-web-pt-021119)
- Named and optional arguments and metaprogramming facilitate saving objects to a persistent data store
- SQLite gem DB queries return an array of rows, of which the rows are arrays of columns

Completed the 2 ORM mapping labs.
- We setup DB[:conn] constant hash in environment.rb and use it to talk to the database.
- The example ORM initializes the object's id to nil so we can write it after the db has generated it with its autoincrement feature. We set the instance varible directly inside a save method, since it's an attr_reader.
- Tables represent Classes and rows instance objects

### Day 2: May 2nd, 2019
Completed the Updating Records in an ORM lab.
- Implemented the find or create pattern with the db
- instantiate object, save to db, set db-generated key field in object
- save all attributes to db when updating

Completed Bringing it all Together lab.
- prevent duplication via find or create methods
- reinforced the pattern of mapping an object to a db row, then writing the unique identifier generated by the db
